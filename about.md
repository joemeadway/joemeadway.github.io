Joe Meadway lives in Hong Kong and works as a developer. This site is a place to collect together the notes, snippets, thoughts and occasional longer pieces that he would rather not forget. As such, content may range from being half-baked notes-to-self, to step-by-step instructions for getting things set up, throught to longer essays that may eventually become presentations etc.
