Development Setup

1) Develop basic SQL Server + ASP.NET Core app in VS.
	- if at a later date we need to separate into smaller blocks, or back & front end, can do so

2) Source Code in VSTS
	- easiest integration with Azure

3) Host in app in Azure, with SQL database
	- deployment slots
		- dev, staging, prod
		
	
3) Set up Build Definition
	- trigger on check in per branch
	- can basically trigger the build, tests and publish
