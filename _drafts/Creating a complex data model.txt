Creating a Complex Data Model
https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/data/ef-mvc/complex-data-model.html


Customise the Data Model with Attributes

Attributes to specify
	- Formatting
	- Validation
	- Database Mapping Rules
	
The DataType attribute

Can use to make changes such as only showing Date from a DateTime
	- [DataType(DataType.Date)]
	- has many enumerations, Date, Time, PhoneNumber, Currency, EmailAddress, etc.
		- Application can provide many type-specific fewatures
			- e.g. including 'mailto' on email address rendering
	- do not provide validation
		- emits a data- attribute for HTML5
	
Or formatting
	- [DisplayFormat(DataFormatString = "{0:yyyy-MM-dd}", ApplyFormatInEditMode = true)]
	
The StringLength attribute
	- will enforce a column width on DB
	
ColumnName
	- allows property mapping to a column that doesn't match name
	
Display(Name = "Some Display Name")
	- allows definition of default rendering
	
Required
	- makes a property required
	- not necessary on non-nullable types
	- alternatively, on string types could set 'StringLength(50, MinimumLength=1)'
	
Can create properites with only Get methods
	- typically will not have a column created in the DB
		- e.g. 
		public string FullName
        {
            get
            {
                return LastName + ", " + FirstMidName;
            }
        }
			- made up of two other columns
			

Navigation Properties
	- mark as 'virtual' means that the data from that proeprty will be lazily loaded
	- can also give more efficient change tracking
	- collections mark out a 'many' relationship
		- can specify as an ICollection, or List, or HashSet
		- ICollection is implemented as HashSet by default
		
Create OfficeAssignment entity
	- these are the mapping tables, many-to-many type relationships
		- c.f. traveller-to-tour mapping
	
Key Attribute
	- 'Key' marks out a property as a PrimaryKey
		- in case the property doesn't match the pattern for naming
		
Not required to mark the Foreign Keys etc.
	- EF will sutomatically generate them when there is a navigation property
	- but can make the database model updating simpler and more efficient
