Linting rules can be used to enforce consistency across code, for things like
- setting a standard for opinions such as curly brace position
- best practices such as avoiding certain language constructs
- avoiding common mistakes, such as using `==` for equality comparitors or missing a `default` case on a switch statement

Options
- JSLint
- JSHint
- ESLint

**Configuring ESLint**

Can set in `package.json`, or (more commonly) set in specifc file: `.eslintrc.json`

`"eslint:recommended"` - take recommended rules  
`"plugin:import/errors"` - import ES6 errors  
`"plugin:import/warnings"` - import ES6 warnings  

Set which environments to lint with 

```
  "env": {
    "browser": true, //what environments should be linted for?
    "node": true,
    "mocha": true
  },
```

and set rules to override with
```
  "rules": { //override rules
  	"no-console": 1 //1 - warning, 2 - error, 0 - off
  }
```

**ESLint doesn't watch files**

To set up a file watcher, there are a few options, but 

eslint-watch
- npm package, not tied to webpack
- good warning formatting, clean messages
- easy to use to lint tests, configs, and build scripts too

Set up an npm task such as  

`"lint:watch": "npm run lint -- --watch"` 

Also look at **babel-eslint** - adds experimental features missing from standard ESLint.

Why lint, rather than just depend on editor catching problems? 
- gets all error output to command line
- control full configuration
- can add into continuous integration
