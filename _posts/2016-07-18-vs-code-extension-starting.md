Simplest setup is to use the yeoman generator created by Microsoft, which will scaffold out a 'Hello World' extension project in Javascript or Typescript, complete with tests and a git repo initialised. Pretty neat.

```
npm install -g yo generator-code
yo code
```

Simply fill in the relevant prompts when required, and you'll have a brand new 'test-extension' folder created below where you ran the tool.
