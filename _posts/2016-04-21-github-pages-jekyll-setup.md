Is fairly simple to set up, using a combination of the pages on the github site

- create repo  
- generate site  
- create master branch
     - github picks up personal pages from master branch, and project pages from gh-pages
- create github remote repo - called `<username>.github.io`
     - even if using a custom domain name, will need to call the repository this
- github will pick up the master branch and generate when it's pushed to
